# Brain-Store-m Board 📝

Brain-store-m Board is an application to store brainstormed ideas akin to virtual sticky notes that can be edited on the fly as well as shared with others via a public feed to promote further ideation. A user will make an account to login and begin creating the ideas they want to save on their board. Hitting the "Your Ideas" tab in the navigation bar will bring you to you board. Hitting the "Create A New Idea" button will generate a new note. Simply clicking on the note will allow you to edit and change the title and description of your idea. Edits are automatically saved and presist via the backend once a user clicks away from their newly edited note. A user can then also choose to share their ideas publicly by unchecking the "private" checkbox. All newly created ideas are private by default. Then checking the "Shared Ideas" tab will allow you to view all public ideas shared by others, yours included if you have any.

This is Brain-Store-M Board's frontend repository. Please go [here](https://github.com/pastasauce59/brain-store-m-board_backend) for the backend repository.
